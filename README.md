# Let's start with a high level overview.
A rule can run in response to an event or at certain time intervals. For example, to periodically run an AWS Lambda function, you can create a rule to run on a schedule.
Using Cloudwatch events, I will configure a rule to trigger a lambda function every three minutes.

Let's start by going to the AWS console and typing CloudWatch. On the left pane of the CloudWatch, go to events and click on rules.

On the rules page, select Create Rule.
