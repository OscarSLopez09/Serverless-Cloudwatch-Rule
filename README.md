# Let's start with a high level overview.
A rule can run in response to an event or at certain time intervals. For example, to periodically run an AWS Lambda function, you can create a rule to run on a schedule.
Using Cloudwatch events, I will configure a rule to trigger a lambda function every three minutes.

Let's start by going to the AWS console and typing CloudWatch. On the left pane of the CloudWatch, go to events and click on rules.
